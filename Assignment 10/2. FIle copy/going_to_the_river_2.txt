"I HAVE BECOME SO COMPLETE IN MY KNOWLEDGE THAT I, AS IT WERE, HAVE BEEN LIVING
FOR A HUNDRED TRILLION BILLION YEARS ON TRILLIONS AND TRILLIONS OF THE SAME
PLANETS AS THIS EARTH, THIS WORLD IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR TO ME, AND I AM HERE
LOOKING FOR ONLY ONE THING - CALMNESS, TRANQUILITY AND THIS HARMONY, FROM
MERGING WITH THE INFINITELY ETERNAL, FROM CONTEMPLATING THE GREAT FRACTAL
SIMILARITY AND FROM THIS WONDERFUL UNITY OF BEING, INFINITELY ETERNAL,
WHEREVER YOU LOOK, EVEN DEEP DOWN - INFINITELY SMALL, EVEN UPWARD - INFINITELY
LARGE, DO YOU UNDERSTAND?"
